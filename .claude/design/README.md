# Sanad Tech — Design reference (imported from Claude Design)

These files are the **canonical visual reference** for the Sanad Tech website (P8) and the
admin + client portals (P7). They were produced in **Claude Design** and imported here so the
build has one fixed, authoritative source of truth for tokens, layout, and the signature
interaction — instead of inventing values at build time (U6 / WEB9 / WEB10).

> ⚠️ **Read this before using anything here.**
> - **Tokens, layout, spacing, the signature scene, RTL handling → authoritative.** Build P7/P8 to match.
> - **The copy in the designs is PLACEHOLDER.** Do **not** treat the design's Arabic/English strings
>   as the product's default content. The real default copy is authored in
>   [`content-defaults.md`](./content-defaults.md) and is what seeds the settings/content services
>   (U9 coded defaults). Final content is admin-editable from the CMS.
> - **The generated logo was discarded** (owner's call). The brand mark is produced separately from
>   [`logo-prompt.md`](./logo-prompt.md) via ideogram.ai.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`design-spec.md`](./design-spec.md) | The locked token system + shell + signature spec. **Build against this.** |
| [`content-defaults.md`](./content-defaults.md) | Professional bilingual (ar-first / en) **default** copy that replaces the placeholders. |
| [`logo-prompt.md`](./logo-prompt.md) | Paste-ready ideogram.ai prompt for the سَنَد التقنية mark. |
| `source/Sanad Landing.dc.html` | Archived raw design (landing). |
| `source/Sanad Admin.dc.html` | Archived raw design (admin portal). |

## Re-pulling any source on demand (canonical store)

The permanent source of truth is the Claude Design project. Any of the six surfaces can be re-pulled
via the `claude_design` MCP (`DesignSync` → `get_file`) — re-run `/design-login` first if auth lapsed.

- **Project:** `Support thread identity system`
- **projectId:** `c71e9e18-fec7-4ed0-a30d-553c3d3eca3e`
- **Files:** `Sanad Landing.dc.html`, `Sanad About.dc.html`, `Sanad Services.dc.html`,
  `Sanad Service Detail.dc.html`, `Sanad Admin.dc.html`, `Sanad Client.dc.html`
  (`Sanad Logo.dc.html` is intentionally **excluded** — discarded.)
- Shared runtime in the project: `cosmos.js` (the signature WebGL scene), `support.js` (the Design
  Component runtime — **not** part of our build; we re-implement the scene per the spec).

> Only `Landing` + `Admin` are mirrored locally (they're the most complex references). The other four
> returned inline during import and were not auto-persisted; pull them with `get_file` when needed —
> their full structure and copy are already distilled into `design-spec.md` + `content-defaults.md`.

## How the designs map to the build

| Design file | Surface | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `Sanad Landing.dc.html` | Website landing | P8 |
| `Sanad About.dc.html` | Website /about | P8 |
| `Sanad Services.dc.html` | Website /services | P8 |
| `Sanad Service Detail.dc.html` | Website /services/[slug] | P8 |
| `Sanad Admin.dc.html` | Admin portal shell + screens | P7 |
| `Sanad Client.dc.html` | Client portal shell + screens | later (post-MVP) |

The token foundation extracted here is seeded into `libs/shared/config` (Tailwind preset + token CSS)
during **P0**, so every later surface resolves real brand tokens from day one.
